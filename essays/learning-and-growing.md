Going into ICS 314: Software Engineering I with little understanding of what software engineering is and much less experience with the topic, my main goal of this semester is to have a greater grasp on the field. So far, I have seen the course will involve Web development, which is quite intriguing. At the moment, the idea of being able to write the code to maintain a Webpage, much less a Website, seems impossible. Hopefully, the ICS 314 course will prove otherwise.

Outside of the expected intention to learn to code from a class with programming focuses, I would hope to have greater insight into the field of Computer Science and maintaing a professional presence on the Internet.

As graduation from college approaches, it has beceome more pressing to figure out what my post-graduate plans are and carrers of interest. While I am still trying to find what career fields suit my interests, skills, and values, I hope that this course, and the future courses I am enrolled in, will provide me with some of the experiences necessary to figure it out. Despite purusing only a minor in Computer Science, I plan to absorb as much knowledge as I can through the classes I do take. I belive Computer Science and programming are important skills to gain and apply to any field as our society progresses technologically.

Stepping away from school and career, the professor has designed the ICS 314 course to utilize his own "Athletic Software Engineering" pedagogy which puts focus on practice and competency, where acquiring skills is viewed as greater than just the ability to explain a concept. This system, I think, reflects views on learning, in general, that extend towards understanding over memorization. This excites me about the course and about the skills I will develop from it. I hope to keep learning, my entire life, in and out of the classroom. I firmly believe backgrounds in problem-solving and design fields like software engineering will help ensure that.
